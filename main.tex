\begin{abstract}

	Defect prevention is crucial, but frequently not enoughly emphasized part of software development process. In this paper we present our interpretation of defect prevention, followed by a study of different defect prevention techniques - their pros and cons, cost and benefit analysis. Alternative solutions to avoid defects in the final product are presented. Finally, specific project is desbribed together with recommendations for defect prevention techniques.
